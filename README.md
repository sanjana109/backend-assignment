# Backend Assignment

Create REST APIs using Python (Flask, Django, any other web framework of your choice) for managing the user’s data.  
You can use database(i.e SQL, NOSQL) of your choice to store the data.  
Take sample data from [here](https://datapeace-storage.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dummy_data/users.json).

The rest framework used here is Django and the database selected for managing the user data is MySQL. The user data has been taken from the sample data already given. It is assumed as employee (user) data. 

It has the functionalities:

- list users (`/api/users GET`)
- search for a user by name
- sort list by field name
- pagination of users list
- create new user (`/api/users - POST`)
- get detail of a user (`/api/users/<id> - GET`)
- update details of a user (`/api/users - PUT`)
- delete a user (`/api/users - DELETE`)

## **Task Overview**

User should have the following attributes:-

```
ID
First Name
Last Name
Company Name
Age
City
State
Zip
Email
Web
```

Application should have the following endpoints:

- `/api/users - GET` - To list the users

  - Response with HTTP status code 200 on success

    ```json
    [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "first_name": "James",
        "last_name": "Butt",
        "company_name": "Benton, John B Jr",
        "city": "New Orleans",
        "state": "LA",
        "zip": 70116,
        "email": "jbutt@gmail.com",
        "web": "http://www.bentonjohnbjr.com",
        "age": 70
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "first_name": "Josephine",
        "last_name": "Darakjy",
        "company_name": "Chanay, Jeffrey A Esq",
        "city": "Brighton",
        "state": "MI",
        "zip": 48116,
        "email": "josephine_darakjy@darakjy.org",
        "web": "http://www.chanayjeffreyaesq.com",
        "age": 48
      }
    ]
    ```
- `/api/users/scan - GET` for supporting query parameters
  - Also, supports some query parameters:
  - page - a number for pagination
  - limit - no. of items to be returned, default limit is 5
  - name - search user by name as a substring in First Name or Last Name (Note, use substring matching algorithm/pattern to match the name). It should be case-insensitive.
  - Sort - name of attribute, the items to be sorted. By default it returns items in ascending order if this parameter exist, and if the value of parameter is prefixed with ‘-’ character, then it should return items in descending order

  Sample query endpoint:- `/api/users?page=1&limit=10&name=James&sort=-age` This endpoint should return list of 10 users whose first name or last name contains substring given name and sort the users by age in descending order of page 1.

- `/api/users - POST` - To create a new user

  - Request Payload should be like in json format :-

    ```json
    {
      "id": 2,
      "first_name": "Josephine",
      "last_name": "Darakjy",
      "company_name": "Chanay, Jeffrey A Esq",
      "city": "Brighton",
      "state": "MI",
      "zip": 48116,
      "email": "josephine_darakjy@darakjy.org",
      "web": "http://www.chanayjeffreyaesq.com",
      "age": 48
    }
    ```

  - Response with HTTP status code 201 on success
    ```json
    {}
    ```
  - This endpoint will create a new user inside the database

- `/api/users/{id} - GET` - To get the details of a user

  1. Here {id} will be the id of the user in path parameter
  1. Response with HTTP status code 200 on success

  ```json
  {
    "id": 1,
    "first_name": "James",
    "last_name": "Butt",
    "company_name": "Benton, John B Jr",
    "city": "New Orleans",
    "state": "LA",
    "zip": 70116,
    "email": "jbutt@gmail.com",
    "web": "http://www.bentonjohnbjr.com",
    "age": 70
  }
  ```

  Sample query looks like:- `/api/users/1 GET`

- `/api/users/{id} PUT` - To update the details of a user

  - Here {id} will be the id of the user in path parameter
  - Request Payload should be like in json format for updating first name, last name and age:-
    ```json
    {
      "first_name": "Josephine",
      "last_name": "Darakjy",
      "age": 48
    }
    ```
  - Response with HTTP status code 200 on success
    {}

- `/api/users/{id} DELETE` - To delete the user

  - Here {id} will be the id of the user in path parameter
  - Response with HTTP status code 200 on success

    ```json
    {}
    ```
